## CombatHUD

Combat HUD provides a number of combat-related HUD tools, all of which can be toggled on/off and customized:

* Status Timers: show remaining lifespans above the icons
* Numerical Vitals: show player's HP / Stamina / Mana values as numbers
* Floating Damage Labels: With color for each damage, can customize the text size, speed, lifespan, etc
* Target Enemy Info: Status Effects, remaining Health label, and an ARPG-style "Enemy Infobox" to view in-depth stats

The config can be managed through the [Config Manager](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/Mefino/Outward_Config_Manager/), or the r2modman Config Editor, or by editing the file at `BepInEx\config\com.sinai.combathud.cfg`.
