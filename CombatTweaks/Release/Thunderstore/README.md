## Combat Tweaks

Previously known as Combat and Dodge Overhaul, this is a 'lite' version with only the features I actually use myself. Fully customizable and toggle-able.

* Adjust the 'hit-stop' effect (the slow-down when a weapon collides with a target)
* Allow dodge to cancel attacks and other actions
* Allow attack input to interrupt blocking

The config can be managed through the [Config Manager](https://outward.thunderstore.io/package/Mefino/Outward_Config_Manager/), or the r2modman Config Editor, or by editing the file at `BepInEx\config\com.sinai.combattweaks.cfg`.
